# 🤖 AI Knowledge Assistant

An AI-powered Knowledge Assistant built using **n8n**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Embeddings**, and **Vector Search**. The system allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions in natural language. Relevant information is retrieved from the uploaded documents using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, enabling accurate and context-aware responses based on the document content.

## Tech Stack

### Backend & AI

* n8n
* Large Language Model (LLM)
* Embedding Model
* Vector Database
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## How It Works

1. The user uploads a PDF document.
2. The document text is extracted automatically.
3. The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks.
4. Embeddings are generated for each text chunk.
5. The embeddings are stored in a vector database.
6. The user asks a question related to the uploaded document.
7. Relevant document chunks are retrieved through semantic search.
8. The retrieved context is provided to the LLM.
9. The LLM generates an accurate answer based on the retrieved information.
